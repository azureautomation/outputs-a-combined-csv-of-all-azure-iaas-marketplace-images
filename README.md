Outputs a combined csv of all Azure IaaS MarketPlace Images
===========================================================

            

 

 Quickly and Easily Output all available MarketPlace Image Types and their corresponding Publisher, Offer and SKU for any region in Azure. Depends on Azure PowerShell 2.0.1 and higher. 

Without this script you will need to go through the Azure Market Place images 1 publisher at a time. The script also cleans up after itself. 
Once the script completes execution a sku-date.csv file will be available in the directory the script was executed in.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
